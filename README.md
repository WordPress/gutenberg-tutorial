# Example Code From The Developer’s Guide to the Block Editor Course
The [Developer’s Guide to the Block Editor](https://learn.wordpress.org) course is a deep dive into WordPress development with Gutenberg. This is the example code for that course, presented as functional plugins and a theme.

You can use this code to inspire your next Gutenberg block or even use it as the beginning of your own creation. Not sure how to create a block or what a block or a Gutenberg is yet? No worries, we have detailed tutorials for all of these concepts and code.
